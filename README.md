# Aquarium
A little project I've played around with, built with LibGDX.

The plan is to make this into a full game.

the concept is simple, you have an aquarium, in which you raise fish
In the future the player will be able to feed the fish, purchase new fish and decorations and earn coins from different interactions with said fish.

As of now not much is happenning in the game, fish (now represented as rectangles) are randomly generated on the screen, all with random colors
and are programmed to randomly "decide" to swim to some other point on the screen, the fish will respond to touch events and follow player's finger

Here is a gif to reflect current game state (fish clutter when a touch event occur)

Sorry for the low quality, the fish movement is really smooth when run on a device/emulator :)
